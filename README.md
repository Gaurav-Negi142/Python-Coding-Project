# Python-Coding-Project

Welcome to the **Python Coding Project** repository!  
This project is a comprehensive collection of **30 Python tasks** designed to demonstrate core programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and practical applications of Python. It serves as a capstone project showcasing proficiency in loops, conditionals, functions, object-oriented programming (OOP), and error handling.

## 📖 Project Overview
The repository contains solutions to diverse coding challenges, ranging from simple calculations to real-world inspired scenarios. Each task is implemented with clean, well-structured code and includes explanations to make the logic easy to follow.

Key concepts covered:
- Data types, indexing, and slicing
- Operators and in-built functions
- Statements, indentation, and conditionals
- Loops and iterations (for, while, nested loops)
- Custom functions
- Advanced looping concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, methods, encapsulation)
- Exception handling

## 🎯 Selected Tasks for Video Explanation
As part of the project submission, five tasks are explained in detail through a video walkthrough:
1. **Guess the Number** – Random number guessing game using loops and conditionals.  
2. **Calculator (OOP)** – A class-based calculator implementing arithmetic operations.  
3. **Basketball Game (while loop)** – Simulating scoring until a target is reached.  
4. **Bank Account (OOP)** – Class with deposit/withdraw methods and error handling.  
5. **Time Conversion (OOP)** – Converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM and input validation.
